If we check by Max/Min temperatures, we can say that max temperature in June and December are almost the same, it's 85 degrees Fahrenheit and  83 degrees Fahrenheit respectively. Min temperature in June and December has bigger fluctuation - 64 and 56 respectively. 

Summary: 

Based on the statistical analysis,  we can advise the business owner to  open surf and ice cream bar  in Hawaii. 

I ran additional queries to visualize the frequency of the temperatures in June and December to see how it fluctuates during the month.

By looking at the graph we can see that even though December and June  statistics are  very similar, December  has more days with lower temperatures than June. If the business owner decides to proceed and open the icecream and  surf spot, I'd recommend adjusting its working schedule in December and reduce working hours or even days since the weather will not be as good as in summer,  but not too bad to close it completely.
